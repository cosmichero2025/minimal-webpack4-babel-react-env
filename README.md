# Minimal webpack4/babel/scss/react dev enviroment 

Wanted to learn more about webpack since I was using create-react-app for a while so I was left in the dark about how everything worked. Decided on using webpack-dev-server because its awesome and didn't want to spend a day or two making a good server from scratch. This is mostly for me to clone from but if anyone wants it..... there ya go.
